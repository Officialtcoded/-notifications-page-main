# Notifications Page

Rem-responsive notifications UI with accessible interactions and clean design.

![Preview](preview.jpg)

## Overview

- **Tech**: HTML, CSS (custom properties, Grid/Flex), vanilla JS
- **Responsive**: `1rem = 10px` via `html { font-size: 62.5%; }`
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard operable, visible focus states, ARIA labels

## Features

- Toggle individual notifications read/unread
- "Mark all as read" updates states and unread counter
- Fluid spacing and sizing using `rem` units; breakpoint in `rem`

## Notable decisions

- Converted all `px` sizes to `rem` for better scaling across devices
- Replaced fixed image attributes with CSS-driven sizes for consistency
- Kept color tokens and typography in `:root` for easy theming

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
